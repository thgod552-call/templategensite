# TemplateGen (starter)

A minimal starter for TemplateGen â€” a small React + Vite app that generates one-page static sites from a form. It uses Tailwind for styling and LocalStorage for sharing.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

3. Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

What I scaffolded

- Vite + React project files
- Tailwind config and PostCSS config
- Pages: Home (form), Preview (generate + download + share), Site (/site/:id)
- Simple LocalStorage utilities

Next steps I can do for you

- Add multiple templates and a template chooser
- Persist sites across sessions and add a small listing page
- Add tests and types (TypeScript)
- Wire up a ZIP download instead of a single HTML file

If you want me to run `npm install` and start the dev server from here, tell me and I'll run the commands in your terminal.
